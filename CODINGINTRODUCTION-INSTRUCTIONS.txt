(THANKS TO SOPHIA FOR SUGGESTING THE USE OF GITHUB)
TO ALL CODERS FOR TEAM 569D:

GITHUB IS WHERE WE WILL BE STORING OUR CODE SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS, EDIT, AND UPLOAD FILES FOR THE PROGRAM.

THERE WILL BE ONE MAIN CODE THAT WILL BE THE ONE DOWNLOADED TO THE ROBOT PRIMARILY (RIGHT NOW IS LABELED AS "TESTprogram") THAT EVERYONE
  CAN ADD TO AND WORK ON.

IF YOU MAKE AN AUTONOMOUS CODE, HERE ARE THE STEPS TO DO SO:
  1. CREATE A NEW FILE IN VEXCODE THAT CONTAINS AN int main, IN WHICH YOU CAN WRITE THE AUTONOMOUS PROGRAM
  2. DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND UPLOAD THE FILE TO GITHUB IN THE "AUTONOMOUS" FOLDER
  3. CREATE A SIMPLE TEXT WRITEUP OF THE FUNCTION OF THE AUTONOMOUS CODE
  4. WRITE A NOTEBOOK ENTRY ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE, ANY FURTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS YOU MIGHT MAKE (IF ANY), AND PLEASE ADD LABELED
       PICTURES OF THE CODE. EVEN IF THERE WAS AN ENTRY FOR THE CODE DONE FOR THAT DAY, CONTINUE WITH ADDING IN YOUR INFORMATION
       
IF YOU MAKE OR FIND ANY USEFUL TEMPLATE CODES (EX: HOW TO DISPLAY THE BATTERY VOLTAGE ON THE SCREEN), HERE ARE THE STEPS TO DO SO:
  (IF YOU ARE WRITING THE CODE)
  1. CREATE A NEW FILE IN VEXCODE THAT CONTAINS AN int main, IN WHICH YOU CAN WRITE YOUR TEMPLATE
  2. DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND UPLOAD THE FILE TO GITHUB IN THE "TEMPLATES AND EXAMPLES" FOLDER
  3. CREATE A TEXT WRITEUP OF THE FUNCTION OF THE SAMPLE CODE, INCLUDING WHAT PARTS TO CHANGE (IF IT'S A TEMPLATE), HOW TO CHANGE THEM
       TO APPLY TO YOUR CODE, AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD
  4. WRITE A NOTEBOOK ENTRY ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE, ANY FURTHER IMPLEMENTAIONS YOU MIGHT MAKE (IF ANY), AND PLEASE ADD LABELED
       PICTURES OF THE CODE, EVEN IF THERE WAS AN ENTRY FOR THE CODE DONE FOR THAT DAY, CONTINUE WITH ADDING IN YOUR INFORMATION
  (IF YOU ARE UPLOADING A TEMPLATE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE - i.e. A SAMPLE PROGRAM PROVIDED BY THE VEXCODE APPLICATION)
  1. CREATE A NEW FILE IF YOU NEED TO COPY/PASTE THE CODE FROM SOMEWHERE
  2. DOWNLOAD THE CODE ANF UPLOAD THE FILE TO GITHUB IN THE "TEMPLATES AND EXAMPLES" FOLDER. IF YOU KNOW THE SOURCE OF THE CODE,
       TYPE THE NAME OF THE UPLOADED FILE IN THIS FORMAT: "[name of code] - [source]" (EX: "turningToDistance - VEXCode")
  3. CREATE A TEXT WRITEUP OF THE FUNCTION OF THE SAMPLE CODE, INCLUDING WHAT PARTS TO CHANGE (IF IT'S A TEMPLATE), HOW TO CHANGE THEM
       TO APPLY TO YOUR CODE, AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD
  
IF YOU WRITE ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE CODE (DRIVER CONTROL, SCREEN CODE, ETC.), HERE ARE THE STEPS TO DO SO:
  1. CREATE A NEW FILE IN VEXCODE THAT CONTAINS AN int main, IN WHICH YOU CAN WRITE THE PROGRAM
  2. DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND UPLOAD THE FILE TO GITHUB IN THE "MISCELLANEOUS" FOLDER
  3. CREATE A TEXT WRITEUP OF THE FUNCTION OF THE CODE, WHAT TYPE OF CODE IT IS/WHERE IT IS INTENTED TO BE USED (CAN BE IN MULTIPLE
       AREAS OF THE CODE), INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE IT, AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAY BE HELPFUL TO OTHER CODERS
